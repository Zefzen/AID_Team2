                    <h3>Innovation Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're building an AI-powered application that uses digital twin technology to revolutionize 
                        predictive maintenance in industrial settings. Our solution combines machine data, electricity 
                        usage, and other factors with powerful AI to pinpoint exactly when and how specific parts 
                        need maintenance, then notifies the required personnel.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Problem We're Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's hard for engineers to keep track of when machines need maintenance or repair. Today's 
                        regularly scheduled maintenance is incredibly inefficient since 99% of the time it's not 
                        strictly necessary at that specific time. There's also over-reliance on experienced workers' 
                        knowledge, creating complications with "this is how it's always been done" mentality.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Target Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our target users are factory workers and industries dealing with energy consumption 
                        oscillations or production deficiencies. We focus on technicians, engineers, and 
                        maintenance managers who need better tools to optimize equipment performance.
                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Prototype Dashboard Coming Soon</strong></p>
                        <p>We're developing a dual-view interface: a streamlined dashboard for managers and 
                        a detailed technical view for engineers and technicians.</p>

                            <h3>üéØ Usability</h3>
                            <p>Our users are factory workers, technicians, engineers, and managers working in IKEA‚Äôs production and logistics facilities. The main problem they face is the difficulty in tracking when machines need maintenance or repairs.
                            Our solution is an AI-driven application that uses data from the machines, such as electricity usage and performance indicators, along with digital twin models, to predict exactly when and how maintenance should occur. The system will automatically notify the right personnel, reducing manual planning and administrative work.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="dt-card">
                            <h3>üîç Feasibility</h3>
                            <p>
                               The solution will be built using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and digital twin technology. The digital twin acts as a virtual version of the machine that can be used to run simulations and stress tests. The AI model learns from this data and from real machine data to predict failures and recommend maintenance schedules.
                                Technologies that will be used include AI/ML models, digital twins, cloud computing, and data visualization tools to create dashboards. These dashboards will have different views for managers and technicians.
                                The prototype will first be created using available IKEA data or sample data. Feedback sessions and scenario-based testing will be used to refine the design and usability.

                            <p>
                                This idea fits closely with IKEA‚Äôs operations and values. IKEA runs large, automated facilities where unplanned downtime is expensive and inefficient. By predicting failures and scheduling maintenance ahead of time, the solution helps IKEA stay efficient and reduce waste.
                                    The project supports IKEA‚Äôs 2030 climate-positive strategy by minimizing the use of spare parts, lowering emissions, and reducing wasted energy. It also improves working conditions by reducing conflicts about maintenance timing and allowing technicians to focus on their expertise rather than administrative work.
                                    The concept reflects IKEA‚Äôs values of sustainability, innovation, and people-centered design, while improving operational efficiency and environmental responsibility.

                            <p>
                               Positive impacts include reduced emissions and energy use, fewer wasted materials and spare parts, longer equipment lifespan, and improved worker safety and satisfaction. Predictive maintenance ensures that machines operate efficiently and reduces the risk of sudden breakdowns.
                                Risks include potential data bias or inaccuracy if the AI model is trained on incomplete or poor-quality data, increased energy or computing resources required for simulations, and possible exclusion of workers who are less familiar with digital tools. These risks can be managed through proper data validation, efficient computing infrastructure, and training for users.
