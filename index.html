                    <h3>Innovation Idea</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're building an AI-powered application that uses digital twin technology to revolutionize 
                        predictive maintenance in industrial settings. Our solution combines machine data, electricity 
                        usage, and other factors with powerful AI to pinpoint exactly when and how specific parts 
                        need maintenance, then notifies the required personnel.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Problem We're Solving</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's hard for engineers to keep track of when machines need maintenance or repair. Today's 
                        regularly scheduled maintenance is incredibly inefficient since 99% of the time it's not 
                        strictly necessary at that specific time. There's also over-reliance on experienced workers' 
                        knowledge, creating complications with "this is how it's always been done" mentality.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Target Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our target users are factory workers and industries dealing with energy consumption 
                        oscillations or production deficiencies. We focus on technicians, engineers, and 
                        maintenance managers who need better tools to optimize equipment performance.

                        <p>We're developing a dual-view interface: a streamlined dashboard for managers and 
                        a detailed technical view for engineers and technicians.</p>

                        Our innovation is built on the foundation of Design Thinking principles.

                            <p>
                                We're targeting factory workers and industries with energy consumption issues. 
                                Currently searching for interviewees including Holger Davies (Volvo), Philip Olsson (P√•gen), 
                                and Christopher Moore (IKEA). Our focus is understanding how they prefer maintenance 
                                information to be presented and their current challenges with machine upkeep.
                            </p>

                                <strong>How might we:</strong><br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Reduce administrative work for technicians so they can focus on technical expertise?<br>
                                ‚Ä¢ Remove reliance on experienced workers so maintenance can be done by anyone?<br>
                                This aligns with IKEA's goals to reduce environmental impact by minimizing wasted machine parts.

                            <p>
                                Our solution uses digital twin stress tests and AI training models to mimic how technicians 
                                "learn" machines over time. The AI analyzes real machine data to schedule optimal maintenance. 
                                We'll provide two views: streamlined for managers, detailed for technicians - reducing 
                                inspection time and downtime.

                                First priority: displaying information in a readable dashboard format. We'll use available 
                                IKEA data and example data to design the presentation. This may include AI-powered 
                                (ChatGPT-style) analysis of production line deviations compared to digital twin models.

                                versions. Testing will focus on usability for both manager and technician interfaces, 
                                ensuring the information presentation meets real-world needs.
